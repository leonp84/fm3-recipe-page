## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Ordered and Unordered list can be complicated to margin and pad properly. Centering the display items of list (vertically aligned with the text) is not easy with plain CSS.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - Incredibly helpful for answering detailed question about obscure CSS syntax.
